{"name":"Perspective","tagline":"Give your HTML images a perspective effect while scrolling","body":"perspective\r\n===========\r\n\r\nA jQuery plugin that adds to HTML images a perspective-like effect when the\r\npage is scrolled.\r\n\r\nI got inspired to write **perspective** after watching this\r\n[video](http://youtu.be/1IH6FZlzTRY?t=7s): images act as windows to a different\r\nworld and whenever the page is scrolled, those views change hiding or\r\nrevelealing new details.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThe main idea behind this plugin is to take a selection of HTML images and wrap\r\nthem inside smaller containers enabling us to create a crop-like effect.  So if\r\nyou have an image of 640x480 pixels, the plugin will wrap original images into\r\na _cropper_ element of 640x420 pixels (by default the plugin will crop 30\r\npixels from the top and 30 from the bottom).\r\n\r\nFinally, the plugin will adjust the `offset` of the original images depending\r\non the relative position of the _cropper_ element to the main page, creating\r\nthe perspective-like effect we were looking for.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOnce you have imported the library, using the plugin is as simple as:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$('img').perspective();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd to change the maximum offset images are subject to, just specify that value\r\nwhile enabling the plugin on the selection of elements:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$('.whatever').perspective({\r\n  maxOffset: '20px'\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nCaveats\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe size of the elements the effect is going to be applied on should be known\r\nat the moment the plugin is invoked.  This means that if you are dynamically\r\nadding images to the page you will either have to:\r\n\r\n- Wait for the image to be rendered -- using the `load` event\r\n- Set `height` and `width` properties explicitly -- when applicable\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
